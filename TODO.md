## To Do
- [x] Implement Login
- [ ] Style main webpage
- [x] Store messages and implement persistent messages
- [ ] Assign different colors to connected users so I don't want to airfry my spine when I log on and feel like I'm colorblind
- [ ] Sveltify everything...
- [ ] Find Low-res Verdana Font to make the website look a little more "classic" if you will...
- [ ] Make nametags appear online when their user is connected (explained poorly here, just ask me in-person...)


## Ideas
- [x] Switch from aiohttp 
- [ ] Implement different channels


## For Zane
- [x] Learn how to use GitHub codespaces (not really needed as of 3-14-24)
- [ ] Actually, just learn git in general. You have no idea what Noah is talking about.
